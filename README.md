## Introduction
Predicting sales revenue from available information is useful for any company in following aspects:
1) Company can percieve challenges early and deal with it in a better way
2) It motivates sales team
3) Helps to plan recruitment strategy
4) Can help in future marketing plans
In this project Machine Learning tools are used to generate models which can predict sales revenue with sufficient accuracy
## Dataset
Big Mart Sales data is taken from Kaggle. It contains more than 5000 data points and 12 attributes. 
The attributes are as follows
Item_Identifier, Item_Weight, Item_Fat_Content, Item_Visibility, Item_Type, Item_MRP, Outlet_Identifier, Outlet_Establishment_Year, Outlet_Size, Outlet_Location_Type, Outlet_Type, Item_Outlet_Sales
## Libraries Imported
Used libraries like Numpy, seaborn, pandas, matplotlib,scikit learn etc.
